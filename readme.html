    I have 2 biological siblings, I was adopted. I was brought into my mother's family, she has 8 kids, me and my brother were the only ones adopted. </li>
      <br>
<li>Are you close to any of your siblings?<br>Yes, I am close to my biological sister and brother. I think I am close to Sha because he is my twin and even after the adoption we stuck together. You know how lucky I was to be adopted with him? Most people only take one, I was lucky, my mom took both.</li><br>

<li>So are you not close with your non-biological siblings?<br>No.</li>
<br>
      
<li>So are you not close with your non-biological siblings?<br>No.<br>4a.Why?<br>Long story short, basically mom went into coma, money was involved, they found out they were not getting any. There was one smart remark made that we were not blood related and that was the last time we spoke. 
</li>
<br>
<li>Do you live close to your family?<br>I live close to most of my family.</li>
<br>
      
<li>Do you still talk to your biological family?<br>Ofcourse, after they found me.</li><br>

<li>Found me?<br>Basically, before I found out I was adopted my mom led me to believe that my biological family didn't want me, even though they tried so hard.</li><br>

<li>So how did they find you?<br>My uncle is a cop and my aunt was a lawyer, they found where I went to school, where I lived and they approached me one day.</li><br>
      
<li>Do you still go to a lot of family gatherings?<br>Yes, my aunt forces me.</li><br>
      
<li>Do you enjoy them?<br>Yes, I love them. </li><br>

      <li>Do you feel any animosity towards your mother for stealing you away?<br>I did.<br>11a.Why did?<br>Imagine, being 7 years old and asking where your family was and them saying â€œthey don't want you."
</li><br>

      
      
<li>So how do you feel about it now?<br>Can I still hate her anymore?<br></li><br>
      
<li>Do you have a funny family story?<br>When I was 6, I guess I was watching too much wwe and I slammed a chair into a kids stomach.</li>
